## How It Works

The calculator uses the standard mortgage payment formula:

```
M = P × [r(1 + r)^n] / [(1 + r)^n - 1]
```

Where:
- M = Monthly payment
- P = Principal (loan amount)
- r = Monthly interest rate (Annual rate / 12 / 100)
- n = Number of months

The annual interest rate is calculated as: `Euribor + Spread`
